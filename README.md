### Roxoft on GitHub

Current Projects (which I'll work on when I get time currently): 
 - [EmuRox](https://github.com/rossdrew/emuRox): MOS6502 emulator with visions of become a *well written* NES emulator then other systems
 - [Greenhouse Telemetry](https://github.com/rossdrew/greenhouse-telemetry): Off grid greenhouse monitoring and control with a Rasperri Pi with it's own [blog series](https://dev.to/rossdrew/series/1097)
 - [Pitest CI](https://github.com/rossdrew/PitestCI): A very small script to provide a GitHub badge based on Pitest results.  This needs a lot more work to really be useful

Code Dumps (which are dumping grounds for smaller chunks of unrelated code)
 - [Programing Problems](https://github.com/rossdrew/programmingproblems): Where I keep all of the solutions to small programming problems I've faced via interviews or challenges.

Older Projects (which I'm unlikely to find time for and are probably horribly written):
 - [Spokesman](https://github.com/rossdrew/Spokesman-SFTP): A small server I developed to act as an SFTP wrapper around Amazon AWS boxes.
 - [Zero House](https://github.com/rossdrew/ZeroHour): A script to migrate Rally data to Trello.
