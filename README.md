### Roxoft on GitHub

Current Projects (which I'll work on when I get time currently): 
 - [EmuRox](https://github.com/rossdrew/emuRox): MOS6502 emulator with visions of becoming a *well written* NES emulator then other systems
 - [Greenhouse Telemetry](https://github.com/rossdrew/greenhouse-telemetry): Off grid greenhouse monitoring and control with a Rasperri Pi with it's own [blog series](https://dev.to/rossdrew/series/1097)
 - [Pitest CI](https://github.com/rossdrew/PitestCI): A very small script to provide a GitHub badge based on Pitest results.  This needs a lot more work to really be useful
 - [Journal](https://github.com/rossdrew/journal): A basic Journal append and search application for learning front-end

Code Dumps (which are dumping grounds for smaller chunks of unrelated code)
 - [Programing Problems](https://github.com/rossdrew/programmingproblems): Where I keep all of the solutions to small programming problems I've faced via interviews or challenges.
 - [Build Lab](https://github.com/rossdrew/build-lab): A repo so that I can play with build tools.  Mainly GitHub actions.  Also some code so that I can test those actions.

Older Projects (which I'm unlikely to find time for and are probably horribly written):
 - [Spokesman](https://github.com/rossdrew/Spokesman-SFTP): A small server I developed to act as an SFTP wrapper around Amazon AWS boxes.
 - [Zero Hour](https://github.com/rossdrew/ZeroHour): A script to migrate Rally data to Trello.  

Gists
 - [iSki GPX Converter](https://gist.github.com/rossdrew/510bcfe76aacd30a700216a02bee25eb): A Python script to take GPS path data exported from iSki website and turn it into GPX data that can be loaded into other apps such as Strava.
